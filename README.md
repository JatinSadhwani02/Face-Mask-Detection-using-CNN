# Face-Mask-Detection-using-CNN

I have implemented a Face Mask Detection using the Convolution Neural Network. This project will detect your face with a mask or without mask. If the mask is on your face then it’ll give a result “Mask” and if the mask is not on your face then it’ll give “No Mask”. 

I have split this project into two parts:

--> You can check with a single image. If you give an image of faces to a model, then it’ll classify whether that person wears a mask or not.

--> When you run the program then the camera will be open and model start classifying your face in real time.

So, I have trained my face mask detection model on a dataset and after training, I got above 96% validation accuracy.
